This is already the end of this journey through time.
I really enjoyed making this portfolio because it allowed me to learn more about this fascinating subject of prehistoric animals. For example, I didn't know that the growth spurt in the T. Rex was specific to it and its close cousins, or that the tiger shark was so ancient. I did have some knowledge of the Megalodon and Deinosuchus, however, as these are iconic animals known to most people interested in paleozoology.

I hope you enjoyed this portfolio as much as I did and that you discovered a new world, or rather rediscovered the old world!

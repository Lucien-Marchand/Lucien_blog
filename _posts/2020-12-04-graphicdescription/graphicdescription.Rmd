```{r importation}
zooplankton <- read("zooplankton", package = "data.io")
```

This article will introduce the data "zooplankton" wich shows differences between 1262 subjects of 20 variables, studying the different classes of zooplankton.

```{r graphic}
chart(zooplankton, size ~ class %fill=% class) +
  geom_violin() +
  coord_flip()
```

We can see that there is a big size diversity between classes with classes like Protist or Cladoceran wich have little diversity of size (above 1mm each) and other like Cnidarian wich ave a huge diversity with a minimum at less than 1mm and a maximum of 7 mm.

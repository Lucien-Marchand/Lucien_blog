# Before 9/12/2020
I forgot to complete this post so I can't really remember what I did so far, but as said later I often practice my English watching Netflix and Youtube, but I also play games in English and my mobile phone is set up in English.

Nerly every day, I watch some videos on Youtube in English during 10 or 15 minutes.

I also often watch series on Netflix in English with subtitles. Last time I watched it was on the 3rd of November and I watched a serie called "Erased" wich tell the storie of a man who lived a tragedy in his childhood, but he found out that he was able to turn back time, so he decided to do everything he could to protect the girl he loved when he was young.
